# Mobile-Price-Range-classification

📌 Problem Statement

Bob has started his own mobile manufacturing company and wants to compete with major brands like Apple and Samsung.

However, he does not know how to estimate the price of mobile phones based on their features.

The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between mobile features (such as RAM, Battery Power, Internal Memory, etc.) and predict the price range category of the phone.

⚠️ Note:
This is a classification problem — we predict price range (0–3), not the exact price.

🎯 Objective

Build a Machine Learning model that predicts the price range of a mobile phone based on its specifications.

Price Range Categories:

0 → Low Cost

1 → Medium Cost

2 → High Cost

3 → Very High Cost

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains mobile phone specifications such as:

Battery Power

RAM

Internal Memory

Mobile Weight

Screen Width

Screen Height

Camera Resolution

3G / 4G Support

Touch Screen

WiFi

etc.

Target Column:

price_range (0,1,2,3)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

🚀 Machine Learning Approach
